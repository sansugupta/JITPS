# Monitoring Stack Setup on POC Cluster (`poc**************s`)

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the monitoring stack setup for the POC cluster (`po***************ps`), designed to monitor applications running in the `odoo`, `keycloak`, and `jips` namespaces. The stack leverages industry-standard tools such as Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry to provide metrics collection, log aggregation, distributed tracing, and alerting capabilities. The deployment follows a dynamic provisioning approach for storage, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance. The setup is automated using a Bash script (`deploy.sh`) and Helm charts, with configurations templated for flexibility across environments.

### Objectives
- Monitor system and application metrics for services in `odoo`, `keycloak`, and `jips` namespaces.
- Aggregate and query logs for debugging and auditing.
- Enable distributed tracing for performance analysis.
- Send alerts to Slack for critical issues.
- Automate deployment with a script-driven approach using Helm and Kubernetes.

## Architecture

The monitoring stack consists of several interconnected components deployed in the `kube-prometheus-stack` namespace. Below is an overview of the components, their roles, and how they interact:

### Components and Their Roles
1. **Prometheus (via `kube-prometheus-stack`)**:
   - **Role**: Metrics collection and storage.
   - **What It Does**: Scrapes metrics from applications and infrastructure components (e.g., Node Exporter, Postgres Exporter) using ServiceMonitors.
   - **What It Tracks**: CPU, memory, network usage, application-specific metrics (e.g., HTTP request rates), and Kubernetes cluster health.
   - **Integration**: Stores metrics in a time-series database, exposes them via HTTP endpoints, and forwards them to Alertmanager for alerting.

2. **Alertmanager**:
   - **Role**: Alerting and notification.
   - **What It Does**: Receives alerts from Prometheus based on predefined rules, deduplicates them, and sends notifications to Slack.
   - **What It Tracks**: Alerts for high CPU usage, memory pressure, pod crashes, etc.
   - **Integration**: Configured to send alerts to a Slack channel (`#monitoring`) via a webhook.

3. **Loki (via `loki-stack`)**:
   - **Role**: Log aggregation and querying.
   - **What It Does**: Collects logs from all pods in the monitored namespaces using Promtail, stores them, and provides a query interface.
   - **What It Tracks**: Application logs, Kubernetes events, and container logs, with labels for namespaces (`odoo`, `keycloak`, `jips`).
   - **Integration**: Logs are ingested via Promtail, stored in Loki, and can be queried via HTTP endpoints (e.g., `ht********************************************.io`).

4. **Promtail**:
   - **Role**: Log collection agent for Loki.
   - **What It Does**: Runs as a DaemonSet, scrapes logs from pods, processes them (e.g., parsing JSON logs, adding labels), and forwards them to Loki.
   - **What It Tracks**: Logs from containers, with pipeline stages for filtering (e.g., dropping noisy health check logs) and parsing.
   - **Integration**: Sends processed logs to Loki for storage.

5. **Tempo**:
   - **Role**: Distributed tracing.
   - **What It Does**: Collects traces via OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol), stores them, and provides a query interface for trace analysis.
   - **What It Tracks**: Request traces across services, including latency, errors, and dependencies.
   - **Integration**: Receives traces from OpenTelemetry Collector, accessible via `h******************************************io`.

6. **OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector**:
   - **Role**: Instrumentation and trace/log collection.
   - **What It Does**: The Operator manages OpenTelemetry Collectors, which collect traces, metrics, and logs via OTLP, process them, and export them to Loki, Tempo, and Prometheus.
   - **What It Tracks**: Application traces (e.g., HTTP request spans), metrics (e.g., request counts), and logs (e.g., error messages).
   - **Integration**: Forwards traces to Tempo, logs to Loki, and metrics to Prometheus.

7. **Postgres Exporter**:
   - **Role**: Database metrics collection.
   - **What It Does**: Scrapes metrics from a PostgreSQL database (at `1******************2`) and exposes them for Prometheus.
   - **What It Tracks**: Database performance metrics (e.g., query latency, connection counts).
   - **Integration**: Metrics are scraped by Prometheus via a ServiceMonitor.

8. **NGINX Ingress Controller**:
   - **Role**: Ingress management for external access.
   - **What It Does**: Routes external traffic to monitoring services (e.g., Prometheus, Loki, Tempo) using custom ingress rules.
   - **What It Tracks**: N/A (infrastructure component).
   - **Integration**: Secured with TLS via cert-manager and the `letsencrypt-prod` ClusterIssuer.

9. **Cert-Manager**:
   - **Role**: TLS certificate management.
   - **What It Does**: Automatically provisions and renews TLS certificates for Ingress resources using Letâ€™s Encrypt.
   - **What It Tracks**: N/A (infrastructure component).
   - **Integration**: Provides certificates for secure access to monitoring endpoints (e.g., `de*************************************io`).

### Workflow and Data Flow
1. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Applications in `odoo`, `keycloak`, and `jips` namespaces expose metrics via HTTP endpoints.
   - OpenTelemetry Collector and Postgres Exporter collect application and database metrics.
   - Prometheus scrapes these metrics using ServiceMonitors, stores them, and evaluates alerting rules.
   - Alertmanager sends notifications to Slack for critical alerts.

2. **Log Aggregation**:
   - Promtail collects logs from pods in all namespaces, processes them (e.g., JSON parsing, labeling), and forwards them to Loki.
   - Loki stores logs and makes them queryable via its HTTP API.

3. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Applications are instrumented with OpenTelemetry (via auto-instrumentation for Java and Python).
   - OpenTelemetry Collector receives traces via OTLP, processes them, and forwards them to Tempo.
   - Tempo stores traces and provides a query interface for debugging.

4. **External Access**:
   - NGINX Ingress Controller routes traffic to Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo using domain names (e.g., `de*****************************************.io`).
   - Cert-Manager ensures secure TLS connections.

## Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
The deployment uses environment-specific configurations defined in `environments/dev/poc-************env`:
- `ENV_NAME="dev"`, `CLUSTER_NAME="poc-odooswfjips"`, `DNS_DOMAIN="jips.io"`.
- Storage sizes: `PROMETHEUS_STORAGE_SIZE="35Gi"`, `LOKI_STORAGE_SIZE="10Gi"`, `ALERTMANAGER_STORAGE_SIZE="2Gi"`, `TEMPO_STORAGE_SIZE="10Gi"`.
- Resource limits and requests for all components (e.g., Prometheus CPU: 100m-500m, Memory: 1.9Gi).
- Postgres Exporter credentials for database monitoring.
- Slack webhook for Alertmanager notifications.

### Dynamic Storage Provisioning
To simplify management and ensure scalability, we adopted a dynamic provisioning approach:
- **Prometheus**, **Loki**, **Alertmanager**, and **Tempo** use `volumeClaimTemplates` to dynamically provision Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) using the `sbs-default` storage class on Scaleway.
- Example PVCs created:
  - `prometheus-prom-stack-kube-prometheus-prometheus-db-prometheus-prom-stack-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0` (35Gi)
  - `storage-loki-stack-0` (10Gi)
  - `alertmanager-prom-stack-kube-prometheus-alertmanager-0` (2Gi)
  - `storage-tempo-0` (10Gi)

### Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)
The deployment is automated using `deploy.sh`, which performs the following steps:
1. **Load Environment Variables**: Sources the environment file (e.g., `environments/dev/poc-odooswfjips.env`).
2. **Render Templates**: Uses `sed` to replace placeholders in template files with environment variables.
3. **Create Namespace**: Ensures the `kube-prometheus-stack` namespace exists.
4. **Install NGINX Ingress Controller**: Deploys the controller with a custom ingress class (`custom-nginx`).
5. **Apply ClusterIssuer**: Sets up `letsencrypt-prod` for TLS certificates.
6. **Install Prometheus Stack**: Deploys `kube-prometheus-stack` with custom values from `prometheus-values.yaml`.
7. **Install OpenTelemetry Operator**: Deploys the operator and applies custom resources (`otel-collector.yaml`, `instrumentation.yaml`).
8. **Install Postgres Exporter**: Deploys the exporter with a secret for database credentials.
9. **Install ServiceMonitors**: Configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from OpenTelemetry Collector and Postgres Exporter.
10. **Install Loki Stack**: Deploys Loki and Promtail with custom values from `loki-values.yaml`.
11. **Install Tempo**: Deploys Tempo with custom values from `tempo-values.yaml` and applies an Ingress resource.
